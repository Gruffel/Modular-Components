# Modular-Components

## Order to look at files:
1) page.html
2) f-positioning-positive.html & f-positioning-negative.html
3) Glance at features folder/files
4) example
5) css.html

## Background Information:
Page.html is the default layout the template uses for most use cases.
f-positioning-positive.html & f-positioning-negative.html is the core section that allows the template to have modular 'components' (features as CAS-IT calls them).
The 'Features' folder and files are a list of the 'components' or features that are currently in use or are in transition (deprication for some and integration for others).
Example section is a sample of what it would take to build a page with component(s).
css.html is how the template loads a css file per feature/component per page, this has helped reduce file sizes and load times arounds CSS. (For more information regarding the success in this I reccomend this [Chome Developers - HTTP 203's video](https://youtu.be/3sMflOp5kiQ)


To see what it is like in a complete template look to [Jekyll Template](https://github.com/Gruffel/Jekyll-Template).
